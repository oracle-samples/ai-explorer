## Startup Time

**_Problem_**:
After starting the **Sandbox**, it takes a long time to load the first page.

**_Solution_**:
This is normally the result of a configured database that is inaccessible. Depending on how you've configured the database, if `retry_count`, and `retry_delay` is set but the database is inaccessible, the **Sandbox** will appear to hang for the duration of `retry_count * retry_delay` during the startup.

## Embedding Rate Limits

**_Problem_**:
During embedding, especially when using trial keys, you may experience a failure due to rate limits. For example:

```
Operation Failed: Unexpected error: status_code: 429, body:  
data=None message='trial token rate limit exceeded, limit is 100000 tokens per minute'.
```

**_Solution_**:
Set a rate limit based on the API Key restrictions.


## Testbed Evaluation

**_Problem_**:
During the Evaluation in the **Testbed**, a database error occurs: `DPY-4011: the database or network closed the connection`

**_Solution_**:
Increase the memory of the vector_memory_size.  If this is an Oracle Autonomous Database, scale up the CPU.
