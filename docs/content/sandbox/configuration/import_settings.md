## Import Settings

Once you are satisfied with a specific configuration for your chatbot, the Sandbox allows you to `Download Settings` as they are in a **.json** format.

After clicking on `Browse files`, you will have to select your Sandbox settings **.json** file:

The Sandbox will detect the saved configuration and ask you to apply the new settings:

Once you upload the saved settings, the Sandbox will automatically update the chatbot parameters to match the ones you saved previously and that's it!
