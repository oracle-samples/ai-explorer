# Oracle AI Microservices Sandbox

üöß Developer Preview

## Description

The **Oracle AI Microservices Sandbox** provides a streamlined environment where developers and data scientists can explore the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. By integrating the **Oracle Database** for Vector Storage, the Sandbox enables users to enhance existing Large Language Models (LLMs) through RAG. This method significantly improves the performance and accuracy of AI models, helping to avoid common issues such as knowledge cutoff and hallucinations.
